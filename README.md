# PhaseNoiseMeasurement-Python
Comprehensive guidance on measuring phase noise using a spectrum analyzer and Python

PhaseNoiseMeasurement: This repository is dedicated to providing comprehensive guidance on measuring phase noise using a spectrum analyzer, integrated with Python scripting. The repository is currently under preparation, and code examples along with detailed explanations will be added soon.

We aim to simplify the process of setting up and executing phase noise measurements using common spectrum analyzers, leveraging the flexibility and power of Python. Our initial example includes setting up a signal analyzer, configuring it for phase noise mode, placing markers for phase noise and jitter measurements, and fetching the measurement results.

Keep an eye on this space for more updates, including detailed documentation and practical examples to help you understand and implement phase noise measurement techniques effectively.
