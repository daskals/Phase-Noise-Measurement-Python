Welcome to the **PhaseNoiseMeasurement-Python** repository, your go-to resource for measuring phase noise with a spectrum analyzer, enhanced by the power of Python scripting. This repository is a work in progress, poised to offer rich content including code examples and in-depth explanations.

### Our Objective
We are dedicated to demystifying the process of setting up and executing phase noise measurements. By harnessing the versatility of Python, we make these measurements more accessible and user-friendly. Our forthcoming Python script, named `phasenoise_jitter.py`, will serve as a practical tool in this endeavor.

### What's Inside
Initially, the script `phasenoise_jitter.py` will guide you through essential steps such as:
- Establishing a connection to a spectrum analyzer (using the `pyvisa` library).
- Configuring the analyzer for phase noise mode.
- Setting markers for precise phase noise and jitter measurements.
- Efficiently fetching and interpreting the measurement results.

### Stay Tuned
We are continuously updating this space with comprehensive documentation and practical examples. These resources are designed to enhance your understanding and capability in implementing effective phase noise measurement techniques.

### Resource Highlight
In the 'Resources' section, we feature the document 'The Importance of Low Phase Noise,' available as 'Holzworth_WP_TheImportanceofLowPhaseNoise.pdf'. This document is a treasure trove of information, shedding light on the criticality of low phase noise across various applications and its measurement strategies. It's a must-read for anyone seeking to deepen their knowledge of phase noise characteristics and methodologies.

### Join Us in This Journey
As we build and enrich this repository, we invite you to keep an eye on our progress and contribute to this evolving field of knowledge.
